## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
- 2 1/2 pounds red cabbage - halved, cored, and cut into 1-inch slices
- 1/2 red onion, thickly sliced
- 2 large carrots
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 1 teaspoon garam masala or curry powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1 tablespoon honey, or to taste
- 1/4 cup seasoned rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons olive oil 
- 1/4 cup sliced green onions

## Instructions

Line a baking sheet with foil, and grease with a few teaspoons of vegetable oil. Arrange cabbage slices, cut side up if possible, on the sheet, and drizzle remaining vegetable oil evenly over cabbage.
Set an oven rack about 7 inches from the heat source and preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler.
Broil until the surface of cabbage is lightly charred, 4 to 6 minutes. Times will vary depending on your oven, so watch closely during each charring step.
Use a spatula and tongs to turn cabbage over; return to the broiler to char the other side of cabbage, 3 to 6 minutes.
Once both sides of cabbage are lightly charred, scatter over sliced onions and use a vegetable peeler to make long, thick strips of carrot over the top. Arrange carrot strips evenly on top, and return pan to the broiler.
Broil until carrots and onions begin to soften, about 3 minutes.
Sprinkle salt, garam masala (or any prepared curry powder), and cayenne, and use tongs to mix evenly. Because vegetables will shrink as they cook, use a spatula to move them in from the edges of the pan, removing empty space between them, and forming a nice, even rectangle.
Return pan to the broiler; broil until cabbage is tender, and is charred to your liking, a few minutes more.
Transfer into a bowl, and dress with honey, vinegar, and more salt if needed. Stir in olive oil and green onions. Serve warm, room temperature, or cold.
