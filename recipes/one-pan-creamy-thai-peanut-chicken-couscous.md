## Ingredients

- For the chicken:
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil or olive oil
- 1 pound boneless skinless chicken breast, cubed
- Freshly ground salt and pepper
- For the peanut couscous:
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (15 ounce) can light coconut milk
- ¾ cup low sodium chicken broth (or sub water)
- ½ cup creamy natural peanut butter (just peanuts + salt)
- 2-3 tablespoons gluten free soy sauce (or coconut aminos)
- 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
- 1 tablespoon chili paste or sriracha
- Optional for a spicy peanut sauce: 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (plus ¼ teaspoon more if you love it a little extra spicy!)
- 1 cup pearl couscous
- Add-ins:
- 2 large carrots, thinly sliced
- 3 cups broccoli florets
- 1 red bell pepper, julienned
- To garnish:
- Green onion (green part only), diced
- Fresh chopped cilantro
- Honey roasted peanuts, chopped
- Hot sauce, if desired

## Instructions

Place a large deep skillet over medium-high heat and add in oil. Once hot, add the chicken, season with salt and pepper and cook, about 5-7 minutes total. You don’t need to cook chicken all the way, just about halfway through so it’s nice and golden brown with flavor. Transfer chicken to a bowl or plate and set aside.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and add in the garlic, cooking for 30 seconds, then add in the coconut milk, chicken broth, peanut butter, soy sauce, ginger and chili paste to the same skillet. Whisk together until well combined and smooth. Stir in the couscous, carrots, broccoli and bell pepper; then add the chicken back into the pan; bring to a simmer. Cover the pan, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring every so often to prevent couscous from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
After 15 minutes, remove the lid and gently simmer for 5-10 more minutes uncovered to soak up any excess liquid.
Garnish with chopped honey-roasted peanuts, green onion, and cilantro. Serves 4.
